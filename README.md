# Fine-tuning LLM for medical multiple-choice questions

- **[Full Fine-Tuning on HF](https://github.com/Yushi-Y/NLP-projects/tree/main/Full_FT_HF)**: Fine-tune BERT and VilT for (visual) multiple choice questions using HuggingFace's Trainer() class.
  
- **[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of LLMs](https://github.com/Yushi-Y/NLP-projects/tree/main/LLM_PEFT_HF)**: With HuggingFace's PEFT library, fine-tune casual LLMs (GPT-like models) on medical multiple-choice questions using Q-Lora. I also compared them with fine-tuned BERTs.
