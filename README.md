- **[Patronizing Language Classifier](https://github.com/Yushi-Y/NLP-projects/tree/main/Classify_Patrinosing_Language_HF)**: Fine-tuned the last layer of Transformer-based models on HuggingFace to classify patronising language.

- **[End-to-end Fine-Tuning on HF](https://github.com/Yushi-Y/NLP-projects/tree/main/Full_FT_HF)**: Using HuggingFace's Trainer() class, fine-tune BERT-based models end-to-end for text-classification and (visual) multiple choice questions.
  
- **[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) on LLMs](https://github.com/Yushi-Y/NLP-projects/tree/main/LLM_PEFT_HF)**: Use PEFT to fine-tune Casual LLMs (GPT-like models) on HuggingFace to respond to general-purpose questions, such as medical multiple-choice questions (MedQA), using the AutoTrain or PEFT library.
   
Upcoming project: Visual question answering.
