- **[Full Fine-Tuning on HF](https://github.com/Yushi-Y/NLP-projects/tree/main/Full_FT_HF)**: Using HuggingFace's Trainer() class, fine-tune BERT-based models end-to-end for text-classification and (visual) multiple choice questions.
  
- **[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) on LLMs](https://github.com/Yushi-Y/NLP-projects/tree/main/LLM_PEFT_HF)**: Use PEFT to fine-tune Casual LLMs (GPT-like models) in response to general-purpose questions, using HuggingFace's PEFT or AutoTrain libraries on medical multiple-choice questions.
   
Upcoming project: Visual question answering.
